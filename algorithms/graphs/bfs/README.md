## Algorithm description

BFS, breadth-first search is an algorithm similar to [dfs](../dfs/README.md) for traversal of graph. The main difference from the dfs is that bfs explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Usually bfs uses non-recursive implementation with the queue as extra memory.
